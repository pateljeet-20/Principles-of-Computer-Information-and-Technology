Imagine pressing a key on your keyboard. Seems simple, right? But behind the scenes, a series of complex operations unfold in a matter of milliseconds. Let's break this down.

Let's break down the process of how a computer handles the conversion of a decimal number to its binary representation, maps it with ASCII, and then displays it back on the monitor:

1. Input Collection:
Keyboard Interrupt: When you press a key on the keyboard, it sends an interrupt signal to the CPU.
Scan Code Interpretation: The keyboard controller sends a specific scan code for each key press to the computer. The operating system interprets this scan code to determine which key was pressed.
ASCII Mapping: The interpreted key press is mapped to its corresponding ASCII value. For example, if you press the key '2', it's mapped to the ASCII value 50 in decimal.
Buffer Storage: The ASCII value is temporarily stored in a keyboard buffer.
2. Processing:
Fetch: The CPU fetches the ASCII value from the buffer.
Conversion to Binary:
Divide the ASCII value by 2.
Record the remainder (either 0 or 1) as the least significant bit.
Update the number to the quotient from the division.
Repeat the process until the quotient is 0.
The binary representation is the recorded remainders read in reverse order.
Store: The binary result is stored in memory (RAM) temporarily.
3. Output Display:
Graphics Rendering:
The operating system's graphical subsystem is informed that there's new data to display.
The binary number is converted to a visual representation (i.e., glyphs or characters representing '0' and '1').
Video Memory Update: The visual representation is written to a specific location in video memory.
Monitor Display:
The video card continuously reads the contents of the video memory and sends this data to the monitor.
The monitor then displays the visual representation of the binary number based on the signals it receives from the video card.
4. User Interaction:
You, as the user, see the binary representation of the ASCII value of the key you pressed on the monitor.
This process might seem intricate, but it's executed in mere milliseconds by modern computers. The combination of hardware components and software routines ensures that data is processed and displayed efficiently.
